# Google-Fiber-Customer-Service-Tableau-Dashboard
This is my capstone project for the [_Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate_](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/HPTTKJZBKW8J). The project results in a dashboard out of the Google Fiber Customer Service dataset provided by Google instructors.

## Stakeholder's Problem
The stakeholder is the Google Fiber Customer Service Team who wants to answer these questions:

- How often does the customer service team receive repeat calls (follow-ups within the next 7 days) after the first calls of the same customers?
- What problem type generates the most repeat calls?
- From which market city the customer service team receives the most repeat calls?

## My Dashboard

The provided dataset is limited to the Quarter 1 of 2022. You can interact with my dashboard here: [Google Fiber FCR Dashboard | Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleFiberFCRDashboard/Dashboard1?%3Alanguage=en-US&%3Adisplay_count=n&%3Aorigin=viz_share_link). NOTE: It is best viewed via laptop or desktop in full window. 

## I wrote a blog about this
I wrote an article, which includes the contents that an enrollee will expect for the Google Business Intelligence Professional Certificate and the planning I did to create the dashboard.
